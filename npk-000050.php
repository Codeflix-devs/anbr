                <h1>NPK Liquid 000050</h1>
                <p>ANBR’s Emulsion-based Liquid NPK 00:00:50 contains a high concentration of potassium, a vital macronutrient for plants. Potassium plays a crucial role in various plant functions, including photosynthesis, nutrient absorption, water regulation, and disease resistance. By supplying plants with an ample amount of potassium, our fertilizer ensures optimal growth and improved overall plant health.</p>
                <p>It is also termed "the quality nutrient" for its contributing factor in several biological and chemical processes in plants.</p>
                <p>It plays a significant role in improving the sugar content in the fruits and the fruit size as well. Since it also facilitates in the movement of water, and proteins within the plant, this potassium-rich fertilizer triggers the activation of important biochemical enzymes for the generation of Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP). ATP provides energy for other chemical and physiological processes such as the excretion of waste materials in plants. It also plays a major role in helping plants cope with biotic and abiotic stress conditions.

        <p>With its liquid form, it can be easily mixed and applied through various irrigation systems, including drip, sprinkler, or foliar application. This versatility allows for precise and efficient nutrient delivery, ensuring that plants receive the required potassium in the most effective manner.</p>
        <p>Using our in-house research-based innovative process of Microfluidisation, nutrients are ground into a microfluid that has minute particles. This microfluid is an emulsion-based liquid, which can be easily absorbed by the plants and can be stored within the plant for slow and timely release as and when needed. </p>
        <p>We are committed to providing farmers and growers with high-quality fertilizers that deliver exceptional results. With our NPK 00:00:50 Liquid Fertilizer, you can optimize the health and productivity of your crops, leading to higher yields and improved profitability.It also reduces the dependence of farmers on conventional fertilizers to a great extent.

        <p><b>Key Features</b>
            In Liquid DAP fertilizer, between half and three-quarters of the phosphorus is temporarily locked up by chained polymers. The remaining phosphorus is immediately available for plant uptake. With exposure to the soil, enzymes produced by soil microorganisms and plant roots break down the polymer phosphate chains into simple phosphate molecules the plants can digest, though some of the polyphosphates will decompose even without the enzymes. The enzyme activity goes faster in moist, warm soils. Typically, half of the polyphosphate compounds are converted to orthophosphate within a week or two for plant uptake. Under cool and dry conditions, the conversion may take longer. <br>
            Since polyphosphate fertilizers deliver nutrients both immediately and gradually via their combination of both orthophosphates and polyphosphates, plants can use them very effectively, longer. <br>
            Farmers like them for their convenience and balanced nutrient distribution, since liquid fertilizers easily blend with many other nutrients and chemicals, and each drop of fluid is identical to the next.</p>
        <p><b>Advantages </b>
            High nutrient content in a clear, crystal-free fluid that is stable under a wide temperature range and has a long storage life
            Blends fairly easily with other nutrients and crop protection products <br>
            Frequently used as a starter fertilizer due to the nutrient content and chemical properties.
        </p>
        <p><b>Properties </b>
            Clear liquid, sometimes green in colour<br>
            25-50% of the phosphate is immediately available to plants; the remaining 50-75% becomes available over a few weeks to months, depending on temperature, as it is broken down by soil microorganisms
