                <h1>ORGANIC + NPK Liquid 102626</h1>
                <p>A complex fertilizer mixture of all three primary macronutrients, Organic + NPK Liquid 10:26:26 is an all-around solution that delivers Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), and Potash/Potassium (K) in a fixed ratio. </p>
                <p>With a higher ratio of P and K, you can get a complete solution for macronutrient deficiency of all three primary nutrients. Nitrogen which is the most readily found nutrient in the atmosphere may be needed in lesser quantities for some crops in certain soil types. With the benefits of vigorous enzyme activation within the plant that helps the plant grow and become strong enough to fight stress conditions, and a robust root development system, this product also delivers excellent vegetative growth. It helps secrete amino acids and build proteins within the plant.</p><a href="https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=https://anbr.in/organic-npk-liquid-102626.php" class="shared"><img src="new-assets/images/site/_WhatsApp.svg" alt=""> Share on WhatsApp</a>

        <p>Using our in-house research-based innovative process of Microfluidisation, nutrients are ground into a microfluid that has minute particles. This microfluid is an emulsion-based liquid, which can be easily absorbed by the plants and can be stored within the plant for slow and timely release as and when needed.</p>
        <p>With ANBR’s innovative S⁴ and EA² technology, our Emulsion based microfluid fertilizer products are a notch above any competition. The minute particle size of the nutrients substantially improves plant uptake. It also brings in an added benefit of the plants being able to absorb the nutrients and store them in pockets within the plant which facilitates the slow release of nutrients and utilization of the same as and when needed. It also reduces the dependence of farmers on conventional fertilizers to a great extent.</p>
        <p>Having the added benefit of organic components, this product not only delivers in nutrient efficiency but also makes the soil healthier and helps reduce soil pollution compared to conventional NPK fertilizers.</p>
        <h3><img src="new-assets/images/site/spec.svg" alt=""> Specifications</h3>
        <p>Despite phosphorus (P) availability from geologic deposits distributed around the globe, widespread P deficiency in soils limits the growth and productivity of plants in many parts of the world. Because of this, growers commonly add this nutrient to their fields to improve crop yield and quality. Polyphosphate is an excellent liquid P fertilizer used to increase agricultural production.</p>

        <h3><img src="new-assets/images/site/spec.svg" alt=""> Benefits</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Balanced nutrient ratio: The balanced NPK ratio of 10-26-26 provides a proportional supply of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K). This balance supports overall plant growth, development, and productivity.</li>
            <li>Promotes root development: The moderate phosphorus content in the fertilizer stimulates root growth, leading to stronger and healthier root systems. It enhances nutrient uptake, water absorption, and plant resilience.</li>
            <li>Flowering and fruiting promotion: The elevated phosphorus and potassium levels in the NPK 10-26-26 fertilizer are particularly beneficial for flowering and fruiting plants. They support flower formation, fruit development, and improved fruit quality and yield.</li>
            <li>Enhances plant health and stress tolerance: Potassium plays a vital role in plant health and stress tolerance. The higher potassium content in the fertilizer helps plants withstand environmental stressors such as drought, temperature fluctuations, and diseases. It supports overall plant vitality and resilience.</li>
            <li>Improves nutrient availability: It contains organic components that enhance nutrient availability in the soil. These components help release nutrients gradually, ensuring a sustained and consistent nutrient supply to plants.</li>
            <li>Supports soil fertility: Organic components contribute to soil fertility by enriching it with organic matter and beneficial microorganisms. They help improve soil structure, moisture retention, and nutrient-holding capacity, promoting a healthy growing environment for plants.</li>
            <li>Environmentally friendly: Organic components support sustainable agriculture practices by reducing reliance on synthetic chemicals and promoting soil health.</li>
        </ol>
        <p><b>Recommended stage of usage:</b><br/>
        Being an all-around NPK solution, it can be applied during any stage of plant growth; however, ideally, it can be applied during the vegetative stage and fruiting stages of the plant life cycle since that is when the plants generally need nutrients the most. </p>
