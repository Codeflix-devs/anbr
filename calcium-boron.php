                <h1>Calcium + Boron</h1>
                <p>Arihan’s Calcium Boron Liquid is a micronutrient product that delivers both Calcium and Boron to plants. A perfect combination of a secondary nutrient and a micronutrient that play vital roles in the plant growth process respectively. The high level of Calcium and Boron in our formula improves the strength of cell walls and cell division. Calcium and Boron, together make it more resistant to diseases.</p>
                <p>Calcium is essential to plants for their growth and nutrition. It is an essential element for the cell structure since it serves as a constituent for cell walls and cell membranes and hence it is also considered as the structural nutrient for the plant. It also plays a vital role in enzyme activation, such as amylase which is involved in the germination process. Calcium also assists in the movement of carbohydrates within the plant. Also, it is essential for root structure development, especially the tips and meristems. </p>

       <p>
Boron is one of the most critical micronutrients. Deficiency of Boron is the second most commonly found deficiency worldwide after Zinc in plants. Boron is an important component of the cell wall and reproductive structures. It helps in the movement of sugars within the plant, thus enabling the healthy growth of the plant. Boron also helps keep the root structures strong. </p>
       <p>With ANBR’s innovative S⁴ and EA² technology, our liquid gel-based fertilizer products are a notch above any competition. The minute particle size of the nutrients substantially improves plant uptake. It also brings in an added benefit of the plants being able to absorb the nutrients and store them in pockets within the plant which facilitates the slow release of nutrients and utilization of the same as and when needed. It also reduces the dependence of farmers on conventional fertilizers to a great extent. </p>
        <h3><img src="new-assets/images/site/spec.svg" alt=""> Specifications</h3>
        <p>Boron Provides solution to problems caused due to boron deficiency like light general chlorosis, a death of growing plant, deformed leaves with areas of discoloration etc.</p>

        <h3><img src="new-assets/images/site/recommended.svg" alt="">Benefits</h3>

        <ul class="dosage">
            <li>Instant uptake of nutrients by the plants resulting in significant and quick improvement in crop.</li>
            <li>Through this application, nutrient uptake efficiency will be enhanced as losses due to leaching volatilization will be minimized.</li>
            <li>Reduces plant stress and prevents fruit-rot and cracking.</li>
            <li>Improves fruit quality, reduces post harvest losses and improves shelf-life.</li>
            <li>High Calcium content aids in cell wall formation, root development, and overall plant growth.</li>
            <li>Being a liquid solution it provides  a fast response to nutrient deficiencies or imbalances.</li>
            <li>The combination contribute to better fruit quality attributes, such as improved firmness, color, and flavor.</li>
            <li>Labour expenses will be minimized when compared with conventional fertilizer application.</li>
            <li>The nutrients is textured and cohesively balanced. Hence, this will give better result and excellent yield in all crops like fruits, vegetables, flowers, field crops, foliage crops etc.</li>
            <li>All horticultural crops will give awesome results with Calcium boron liquid.</li>
        </ul>
       <p><b>Recommended Stages of application for Calcium Boron Liquid: </b>
       It is ideal to use this product during the root development stages since calcium helps strengthen the root tips and improve root structures.During the vegetative stage, when the plant is actively growing, it can be applied to support vigorous foliage growth and enhance nutrient uptake. Application of Calcium Boron liquid during fruiting and flowering stage can improve fruit quality and reduce the incidence of disorders.</p>
