                <h1>NPK Liquid 00:00:46:5</h1>
                <p>ANBR’s emulsion-based Liquid NPK 00:00:46.5 focuses on the deficiency or requirement of Potassium in the plants. Potassium (K) essentially plays a significant role in plant physiological processes. Therefore, it is required in large amounts for proper growth and reproduction in plants. It is also termed "the quality nutrient" for its contributing factor in several biological and chemical processes in plants.</p>
                <p>It plays an immensely important role in improving the sugar content in the fruits and the fruit size as well. Since it also facilitates in the movement of water, and proteins within the plant, this potassium-rich fertilizer triggers the activation of important biochemical enzymes for the generation of Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP). ATP provides energy for other chemical and physiological processes such as the excretion of waste materials in plants. It also plays a major role in helping plants cope with biotic and abiotic stress conditions.</p><a href="https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=https%3A%2F%2Fanbr.in%2Fnpk-0000465.php" class="shared"><img src="new-assets/images/site/_WhatsApp.svg" alt=""> Share on WhatsApp</a>

        <p>Easily soluble in water, this Emulsion-based liquid solution for the farmers can easily be applied using any of the existing irrigation of fertigation processes that the farmer may prefer. It is very easy for the plants to uptake and the innovative technology used to make this product ensures that farmers get the most out of the product at lesser costs than conventional fertilizers.</p>
        <p>Using our in-house research-based innovative process of Microfluidisation, nutrients are ground into a microfluid that has minute particles. This microfluid is an emulsion-based liquid, which can be easily absorbed by the plants and can be stored within the plant for slow and timely release as and when needed. </p>
        <p>With ANBR’s innovative S⁴ and EA² technology, our liquid emulsion-based fertilizer products are a notch above any competition. The minute particle size of the nutrients substantially improves plant uptake. It also brings in an added benefit of the plants being able to absorb the nutrients and store them in pockets within the plant which facilitates the slow release of nutrients and utilization of the same as and when needed. It also reduces the dependence of farmers on conventional fertilizers to a great extent.</p>

        <h3><img src="new-assets/images/site/spec.svg" alt=""> Advantages :</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Essential in photosynthesis</li>
            <li>It also enhances nutrient uptake by facilitating the movement of other essential nutrients, such as nitrogen and phosphorus, from the roots to other parts of the plant. </li>
            <li>It helps plants maintain water balance, regulates stomatal opening and closing, and activates enzymes that protect against oxidative stress. </li>
            <li>Participates in plant’s protein and starch synthesis</li>
            <li>Formation and translocation of starches, sugars, and fats</li>
            <li>Maintains balance of salts and water in cells</li>
            <li>It enhances plant resilience to various stresses, including drought, heat, cold, and diseases. </li>
            <li>It helps enhance the shelf life of harvested fruits and vegetables, reducing post-harvest losses and improving market value.</li>
            <li>It promotes efficient nutrient utilization and reduces the environmental impact associated with excessive fertilizer use.</li>
        </ol>
        <p><b>Recommended stage of usage :</b>Since this is a potassium-centric mixture fertilizer, it can be applied during the fruiting stages for the best results. It can also be used during stressful conditions since potassium plays a key role in defending crops in stress conditions. </p>
        <h3><img src="new-assets/images/site/recommended.svg" alt=""> Recommendation Crops</h3>
        <p>Fruits (tomatoes, peppers, melons), root vegetables (potatoes, carrots), leafy greens (lettuce, spinach), brassicas (broccoli, cabbage), legumes (beans, peas), grain crops (corn, wheat), fruit trees (apples, oranges), and vine crops (grapes).</p>
