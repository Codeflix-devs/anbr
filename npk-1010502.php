                <h1>NPK Liquid 10:10:50:2</h1>
                <p>ANBR's emulsion-based liquid fertilizer, NPK 10:10:50:02, is specifically formulated to address potassium deficiency or requirements in plants. It provides an equal portion of nitrogen and phosphorus, along with the added benefit of the micronutrient boron. This balanced composition promotes optimal plant growth and development, particularly focusing on potassium needs. Potassium (K) is also termed "the quality nutrient" for its contributing factor in several biological and chemical processes in plants.</p>
                <p>It plays a vital role in improving the sugar content in the fruits and the fruit size as well. Since it also facilitates in the movement of water, and proteins within the plant, this potassium-rich fertilizer triggers the activation of important biochemical enzymes for the generation of Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP). ATP provides energy for other chemical and physiological processes such as the excretion of waste materials in plants. It also plays a major role in helping plants cope with biotic and abiotic stress conditions.</p><a href="https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=https%3A%2F%2Fanbr.in%2Fnpk-1010502.php" class="shared"><img src="new-assets/images/site/_WhatsApp.svg" alt=""> Share on WhatsApp</a>

        <p>With ANBR’s innovative S⁴ and EA² technology, using our micro fluidising process, these emulsion-based liquid fertilizer products are a notch above any competition. The minute particle size of the nutrients substantially improves plant uptake. It also brings in an added benefit of the plants being able to absorb the nutrients and store them in pockets within the plant which facilitates the slow release of nutrients and utilization of the same as and when needed. It also reduces the dependence of farmers on conventional fertilizers to a great extent. </p>
