                    <p>ANBR Elixir Private Limited crop care solutions deliver crops with full, well-developed plant roots that can make the most out of available water and nutrients for crop establishment, especially in conditions that are not ideal for the crops. Our superior agricultural products enhance root growth and development and this, in turn, improves plant vigour. The strength hence acquired by the crops make them better at coping with and recovering from environmental stress, and this leads to better and much more improved quality of crops.</p>
                    <p><strong>Given the harsh conditions that plants have to face in growing during early root development stages. We strongly recommend usage of our products due to the below mentioned reasons:</strong> </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Create bigger, stronger plant root systems that</li>
                        <li>Improve the plant’s ability to absorb nutrients</li>
                        <li>Increase capacity to store carbohydrates that are used to fuel plant growth and development</li>
                        <li>In legume crops, enhance the formation of plant root nodules, which store beneficial bacteria that convert nitrogen into a format the plant can use</li>
                        <li>Increase healthy populations of microbes in soil</li>
                        <li>Enhance the growth and uniformity of shoots (plant stems and their leaves, petals, etc.)</li>

                        <ul>
                            <li>They contain amino acids (the building blocks of plant proteins) that serve as a food source for beneficial microbes in the soil.</li>
                            <li>They contain alginic acid (a complex carbohydrate) that bonds to micronutrients in the soil and makes them easier for the plant to absorb. It also serves as a food source for beneficial microbes in the soil.</li>
                            <li>Some trigger auxin-like activity in plants. Auxins are internal plant hormones that stimulate the initiation of new roots.</li>
                            <li>Some trigger cytokinin-like activity in plants. Cytokinins are internal plant hormones that encourage growth in all areas of the plant, including the roots.</li>
