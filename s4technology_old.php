                <h5>Supernano Sustainable Suspo Solution</h5>
                <h4>S<sup>4</sup> Technology Breaking new ground in NPK</h4>

                <h5>Description</h5>
                <p>The <strong>S<sup>4</sup></strong> Technology (<strong>S</strong>upernano <strong>S</strong>ustainable <strong>S</strong>uspo<strong>S</strong>olution) was developed by ANBR Elixir Private Limited, to exceed the limits imposed by traditional formulation technologies of liquid or solid fertilizers.</p>
                <p>Leveraging decades of pesticide formulation expertise and an in-depth knowledge of plant nutrition product development, <strong>S<sup>4</sup></strong> Technology allows for formulations not possible until today.</p>
                <!-- <p>A short overview of the technology’s characteristics, advantages and benefits is presented in the video below:</p> -->

                <h5>The Gel Form</h5>
                <p>Products integrated with the <strong>S<sup>4</sup></strong> Technology are neither solid nor liquid; instead they have a unique form with a gel-like texture. This innovative formulation type allows for:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li> <strong>High concentrations</strong></li>
                        <li> <strong>2 year shelf-life</strong></li>
                        <li> The use of <strong>both solid and liquid raw materials</strong></li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    <p>While liquid products with high concentrations are prone to phase separation and sedimentation. <strong>S<sup>4</sup></strong> Technology’s gel form prevents such issues.</p>
                    <p>The viscosity of <strong>S<sup>4</sup></strong> formulations changes over time in storage, from an almost-liquid form to solid gel, keeping all components in suspension.</p>
                    <p>This transformation is not permanent but can be fully reversed by simple agitation of the product.</p>
                    <!-- <p>The video below shows a product demo of the <strong>S<sup>4</sup></strong> Technology and showcases the thixotropic properties of the gel form.</p> -->
                <h5>Formulation Possibilities</h5>
                <p><strong>S<sup>4</sup></strong> formulations are not limited to solid or liquid raw materials since the <strong>S<sup>4</sup></strong> Technology allows the simultaneous use of both in the same formulation. This allows unique and innovative raw material combinations, that extend the agronomic possibilities and create new frontiers in nutrition.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Some of the possibilities offered are:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The <strong>addition of NPK sources</strong> regardless of form allowing the use of the more efficient ones.</li>
                    <li><strong>Use of pH stabilizers</strong> allowing the use of even high alkaline or acidic raw material sources.</li>
                    <li><strong>Inclusion</strong> of surfactants, organic activators, isolated vitamins, isolated plant hormones and enzymes.</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <p>All of the above, contribute to the creations of products with higher efficacy than that provided by traditional formulation technologies.</p>
                </br>
                <!-- <h5>Nutrient Uptake</h5>
                <p>When nutrient is foliarly applied, a percentage of them is unable to enter the plant due to the negative charge of the leaves cuticle.</p>
                <p>To resolve this issue, certain of the organic factors used in <strong>EA<sup>2</sup></strong> Technology, bond to nutrients creating neutral organic molecules. This allows greater uptake as the cuticle’s charge does not interact with the neutral molecules (Fig. 1).</p>
                <br>

                <br>
                <br>
                <p>University studies have also shown that E2DA® Technology increases the speed of uptake, with maximum uptake being registered in under two arrows, which renders products integrated with the technology, rain-safe (Fig. 2)</p>
                <br>

                <br>
                <h5>Movement within the Plant</h5>
                <p>With traditional fertilizers, once inside the plant, nutrient efficacy is limited by cell walls, whose presence mean that:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The plant must expend energy to absorb nutrients within the cells, meaning that fertilizer efficacy significantly drops in conditions of abiotic stress.</li>
                    <li>The nutrients primarily move through the apoplastic pathway, which results in their slow, non-uniform translocation within the plant.</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <p><strong>EA<sup>2</sup></strong> Technology uses a series of organic factors that act as dipoles enabling bonded nutrients to enter the cells without the expending of energy by the plant. This enables nutrient to move through both apoplastic and symplastic pathways resulting in faster more uniform translocation (Fig. 2). In addition, it makes products integrated with EA<sup>2</sup> Technology usable even in conditions of stress.</p>
