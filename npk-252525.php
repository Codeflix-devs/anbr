                <h1>NPK Liquid 25:25:25</h1>
                <p>NPK 25:25:25 an emulsion-based liquid fertilizer is a balanced nutrient formulation that provides plants with essential nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K) in a convenient liquid form. This fertilizer offers farmers a range of benefits, including balanced nutrition for healthy plant growth, ease of application, uniform nutrient distribution, enhanced nutrient uptake, potential controlled-release properties, and versatility across various crops. Its balanced ratio of NPK promotes overall plant health, improves crop yields, and enhances the quality of agricultural produce.</p>

    <div class="wrapper">
        <p>An equal ratio of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K) in a fertilizer plays a vital role in supporting plant growth and development. This balanced nutrient ratio ensures that plants receive adequate amounts of each essential element for their optimal health and productivity.

        <p>
            With ANBR’s innovative S⁴ and EA² technology, our liquid emuslion-based fertilizer products are a notch above any competition. The minute particle size of the nutrients substantially improves plant uptake. It also brings in an added benefit of the plants being able to absorb the nutrients and store them in pockets within the plant which facilitates the slow release of nutrients and utilization of the same as and when needed. It also reduces the dependence of farmers on conventional fertilizers to a great extent.

        <h3><img src="new-assets/images/site/recommended.svg" alt=""> Benefits</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>The liquid form of the fertilizer facilitates better nutrient absorption and uptake by plants.</li>
            <li>It promotes vegetative growth and leaf development.</li>
            <li>It helps in protein synthesis, enzyme production, chlorophyll formation, and various metabolic processes within plants.</li>
            <li>It supports root development, flowering, fruiting, and seed formation. </li>
            <li>It supports root development, flowering, fruiting, and seed formation. </li>
            <li>It regulates water uptake and loss, maintains osmotic balance, and enhances plant water relations. </li>
            <li>It improves disease resistance, nutrient uptake, and overall plant vigor. </li>
            <li>It leads to lush green foliage and stimulates the production of new shoots.</li>
            <li>It minimizes nutrient leaching and wastage, reduce the frequency of fertilizer applications, and provide a more efficient and consistent nutrient supply for crops.</li>
            <li>It promotes uniform growth and minimizes the risk of nutrient deficiencies or excesses within the field.</li>
        </ol>
        <p><b>Recommended stage of usage:</b>
        Being an all-around NPK solution, it can be applied during any stage of plant growth; however, ideally, it can be applied during the vegetative stage and fruiting stages of the plant life cycle since that is when the plants generally need nutrients the most. </p>
        <h3><img src="new-assets/images/site/recommended.svg" alt=""> Recommendation Crops</h3>
        <p>This product can be utilized for almost all crops since it has all three nutrients in an equal ratio. However, it is ideal for Leafy vegetables such as lettuce, spinach, kale, and cabbage, fruit-bearing plants like tomatoes, peppers, cucumbers, and eggplants, root vegetables such as carrots, beets, radishes, and potatoes, herbs like basil, parsley, mint, and cilantro, flowering and ornamental plants, and cereal crops such as wheat, barley, and oats.</p>
