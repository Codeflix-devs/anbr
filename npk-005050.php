                <h1>NPK Liquid 00:50:50</h1>
                <p>An Emulsion-based liquid mixture fertilizer made from the combination of the two essential macronutrients Phosphorus and Potassium. A combination that delivers both these nutrients in equal proportion leads to enhanced root development, strong stem and stalk and a robust DNA and RNA as well as getting a wide range of helpful enzymes helping the plant growth. It also plays a role in the stress-fighting strength of the crop with the movement of water within the plant. </p>
                <p>Being an Emulsion-based liquid fertilizer, it is very easy for the plants to uptake and the innovative Microfluidiser technology used to make this product, ensures that farmers get the most out of the product at lesser costs than conventional fertilizers. </p><a href="https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=https%3A%2F%2Fanbr.in%2Fnpk-005050.php" class="shared"><img src="new-assets/images/site/_WhatsApp.svg" alt=""> Share on WhatsApp</a>

        <p>With ANBR’s innovative S⁴ and EA² technology, our liquid gel-based fertilizer products are a notch above any competition. The minute particles of the nutrients substantially improve plant uptake. It also brings in an added benefit of the plants being able to absorb the nutrients and store them in pockets within the plant which facilitates the slow release of nutrients and utilization of the same as and when needed. It also reduces the dependence of farmers on conventional fertilizers to a great extent.</p>
        <p>An ideal option for growers who want to fulfill the deficiency of 2 nutrients with one product.</p>

        <h3><img src="new-assets/images/site/recommended.svg" alt=""> Benefits</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Phosphorus is essential for the development and growth of healthy root systems in plants. It promotes root elongation, branching, and overall root biomass. </li>
            <li>Potassium helps regulate osmotic potential in plant cells, allowing them to efficiently take up and retain water.</li>
            <li>High P facilitates the movement of carbohydrates from leaves to other plant parts, supporting energy production, root growth, and fruit development.</li>
            <li>It influences the synthesis of starch, proteins, and ATP (adenosine triphosphate), which are vital for various cellular processes and overall plant function.</li>
            <li>It also promotes chlorophyll production, contributing to vibrant, green foliage and optimizing the plant's ability to convert sunlight into energy.</li>
            <li>Adequate P and K levels in plants enhance their resistance to diseases and pests.</li>
            <li>It also improves plant tolerance to environmental stresses such as temperature extremes, salinity, and nutrient imbalances.</li>
            <li>Adequate P and K levels contribute to increased crop yield, and improved fruit set, size, and quality.</li>
            <li>Potassium helps maintain nutrient balance within plants. It enhances the uptake and utilization of other essential nutrients, including nitrogen, phosphorus, calcium, and magnesium.</li>
            <li>Potassium is involved in the regulation of stomatal openings.</li>
            <li>Adequate P supply promotes vigorous plant growth, enhances nutrient use efficiency, and optimizes reproductive processes.</li>
        </ol>
