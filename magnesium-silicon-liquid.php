                <h1>Magnesium + Silicon Liquid</h1>
                <p>An effective combination of two important secondary nutrients, Magnesium Silicon Liquid is a very effective substitute for soil conditioners to an extent. It covers the 2 major components of conventional soil conditioners and delivers them to the plants in a much more easily consumable form.</p>
                <p>Magnesium Silicon Liquid is an excellent source of available magnesium which is an element that is very crucial for photosynthesis. It plays the vital role of helping chlorophyll capture the sunlight, which is of utmost importance for the process of photosynthesis. It assists in the movement of phosphorus and phosphates within the plant. It also plays a role in the activation of many enzymes which facilitate the overall growth and development of plants.</p>

        <p>Silicon is the second most abundant element in the earth’s crust and is found in significant quantities in the soil; however, silicon can only be taken up by the plant in the form of mono-silicic acid. It has been found to improve drought tolerance and delay wilting in certain crops where irrigation is withheld and may enhance the plant’s ability to resist micronutrients and other metal toxicities (i.e. aluminum, copper, iron, manganese, zinc, etc.). Also, silicon has been found to help increase stem strength. </p>
        <p>Together these nutrients give a booster of nourishment and nutrition to the plants which cannot be substituted or replaced. </p>
        <p>With ANBR’s innovative S⁴ and EA² technology, our liquid gel-based fertilizer products are a notch above any competition. The minute particle size of the nutrients substantially improves plant uptake. It also brings in an added benefit of the plants being able to absorb the nutrients and store them in pockets within the plant which facilitates the slow release of nutrients and utilization of the same as and when needed. It also reduces the dependence of farmers on conventional fertilizers to a great extent. </p>

        <h3><img src="new-assets/images/site/spec.svg" alt="">Key Benefits: </h3>
        <p><b>Magnesium:-</b></p>
        <ol>
            <li>It increases plant growth, flowering and fruiting.</li>
            <li>It increases crop yield and quality of crop</li>
            <li>It maintains the optimum Ph levels, and helps in high water holding capacity.</li>
            <li>Reduction in irrigation and improvement in drought resistance capacity</li>
            <li>Gives strength to the root and stem of the plant. </li>
            <li>It activates many plant enzymes needed for growth and development.</li>
            <li>It improves chlorophyll content and photosynthesis of plants. </li>
            <li>Enhances carbohydrate usage in plants.</li>
            <li>Improves nitrogen and phosphorous uptake by crops.</li>
        </ol>
        <p><b>Silica:-</b></p>
        <ol>
            <li>It is a rich source of Plant available Silicon.</li>
            <li>It helps against all kinds of abiotic stresses.</li>
            <li>It has high water holding capacity. </li>
            <li>It Neutralizes Aluminium toxicity. </li>
            <li>It strengthens cell walls and helps keep plants growing even in tough conditions. </li>
            <li>It protects plants against many bacterial and fungal plant diseases such as powdery mildew, septoria and eye-spot and also many insect pests.</li>
            <li>There is reduction in irrigation and gives drought resistance to plants.</li>
        </ol>
        <p><b>Recommended stage of usage:</b>Since magnesium helps in the activation of enzymes, it can be used during the flowering and fruiting stages. It can also be used during stress conditions since silicon is a nutrient that helps fight biotic and abiotic stress. </p>
