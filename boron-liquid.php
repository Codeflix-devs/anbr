                <h1>Boron Liquid</h1>
                <p>ANBR’s Liquid Boron 10% is a liquid micronutrient fertilizer which works as both preventive and curative solution to control the insufficiency and deficiency of boron in the crops. It is a micronutrient product that delivers Boron to plant. Boron is a mobile nutrient within the soil, which means it may keep moving within the soil. The window of applying Boron for plants when they actually need it is very small, and hence it is imperative to make it available to all crops evenly at the same time.</p>
                <p>Boron is one of the most critical micronutrients. Deficiency of Boron is the second most commonly found deficiency worldwide after Zinc in plants. </p><a href="https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=https%3A%2F%2Fanbr.in%2Fboron-liquid.php" class="shared"><img src="new-assets/images/site/_WhatsApp.svg" alt=""> Share on WhatsApp</a>

        <p>Boron is an important component of the cell wall and reproductive structures. It helps in the movement of sugars within the plant, thus enabling the healthy growth of the plant. It also helps keep the root structures strong. And it also helps in improved uptake of Phosphorus (P) and Potassium (K) by improving the root structures and cell- membranes. </p>
        <p>The added benefit of nitrogen in the boron 10% liquid helps stimulate vegetative growth. Nitrogen is crucial for the formation of proteins, enzymes, and chlorophyll, all of which are essential components for healthy plant growth. By providing an adequate nitrogen supply, plants can develop strong roots, lush foliage, and robust stems.Nitrogen plays a significant role in improving nutrient uptake by plants. It helps facilitate the absorption and transportation of other essential nutrients.</p>
