                <h1>ORGANIC + DAP Liquid 184600</h1>
                <p>It is the most concentrated phosphate-based fertilizer a farmer can get. A perfect emulsion-based liquid solution for the phosphorus nutrition requirements of plants. Phosphorus is an essential nutrient for plants when it comes to RNA and DNA formation of the plants. Since this NPK mixture has Phosphorus in principal amounts, it also helps in cell division and facilitates growth during root development stages. Similarly, it plays a vital role in seed production stages. It is a very commonly used NPK mixture in the form of DAP (Di Ammonium Phosphate).</p>
                <p>Using our in-house research-based innovative process of Microfluidisation, nutrients are ground into a microfluid that has minute particles. This microfluid is an emulsion-based liquid, which can be easily absorbed by the plants and can be stored within the plant for slow and timely release as and when needed.</p><a href="https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=https://anbr.in/organic-dap-liquid-184800.php" class="shared"><img src="new-assets/images/site/_WhatsApp.svg" alt=""> Share on WhatsApp</a>

        <p>Since ANBR Organic + DAP Liquid 18:46:00 is an emulsion-based liquid, it is easy to apply using existing methods of farmers. It can easily penetrate the soil even if the soil is hardened and not very porous. The minute particle size of the nutrients substantially improves plant uptake. It also brings in an added benefit of the plants being able to absorb the nutrients and store them in pockets within the plant which facilitates the slow release of nutrients and utilization of the same as and when needed. It also reduces the dependence of farmers on conventional fertilizers to a great extent.</p>
        <p>It plays a very important role in photosynthesis and the metabolizing of sugars. Plant roots can only acquire P from the soil when it is dissolved in soil water. Since only deficient concentrations of P are present in the soil water, P must be continually replenished from soil minerals and organic matter to replace the P taken up by plants. Plant roots generally absorb P as inorganic orthophosphate ions (HPO4 2- or H2PO4 - ). Phosphorus present in soil organic matter is not available for plant uptake until soil microbes convert the organic compounds into simple inorganic phosphate. This is precisely where phosphate-based fertilizers play their part . Since it also helps stem and stalk formation and strength, it plays a major role in helping plants cope with unfavourable environmental conditions.</p>
        <p>Having the added benefit of organic components, this product not only delivers in nutrient efficiency but also makes the soil healthier and helps reduce soil pollution compared to conventional NPK fertilizers.</p>
        <h3><img src="new-assets/images/site/spec.svg" alt=""> Specifications</h3>
        <p>Despite phosphorus (P) availability from geologic deposits distributed around the globe, widespread P deficiency in soils limits the growth and productivity of plants in many parts of the world. Because of this, growers commonly add this nutrient to their fields to improve crop yield and quality. Polyphosphate is an excellent liquid P fertilizer used to increase agricultural production.</p>

        <h3><img src="new-assets/images/site/spec.svg" alt=""> Benefits</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>It helps optimize the pH levels of the soil and eventually helps in root development.</li>
            <li>High N improves the quality of leaf and forage crops.</li>
            <li>High P, stimulates plant processes and produces faster, earlier growth.</li>
            <li>Increases yield and reduces crop defects</li>
            <li>It is essential to seed formation and helps improve the quality of grain crops.</li>
            <li>High P concentration helps in normal growth and maturity,</li>
            <li>Effective for greater flowering and fruit set.</li>
            <li>It plays a major role in helping plants cope with unfavorable environmental conditions.</li>
            <li>Being in a liquid form, the nutrients are easily soluble and accessible to plant roots, ensuring efficient nutrient uptake and utilization.</li>
            <li>This ratio is particularly beneficial for crops that require a higher phosphorus-to-nitrogen ratio, such as flowering plants, fruiting crops, and root vegetables.</li>
            <li>The addition of organic components enriches the fertilizer with organic matter, providing additional nutrients and improving overall soil health.</li>
            <li>Organic component increases the soil's water-holding capacity, improves aeration, and enhances microbial activity. It also aids in nutrient retention and reduces the risk of soil erosion.</li>
        </ol>
        <p><b>Recommended stage of usage </b>This fertilizer can be used during the initial seedling stage, and root development stages and can be used until the flowering stages since both Nitrogen and Phosphorus are present in this fertilizer abundantly and can help during the initial developmental stages of the plant life cycle.</p>
