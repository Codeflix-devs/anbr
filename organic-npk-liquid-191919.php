                <h1>ORGANIC + NPK Liquid 191919</h1>
                <p>A product that is one of the most widely used variations of the NPK mixture fertilizers is NPK 19:19:19 which arguably is the most equitable mixture of all the three macronutrients. With Nitrogen, Phosphorus, and Potassium present in an equal ratio of 19:19:19 respectively, this product is the most preferred fertilizer solution for farmers who need all three nutrients without any specific deficiencies or specific nutrient requirements based on crops.</p>
                <p>Nitrogen, the most abundant mineral nutrient in plants, is responsible for the increase in yield and improved crop and food quality. It gives a lushness to the leaves and is considered an essential component of all proteins and enzymes. </p><a href="https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=https://anbr.in/organic-npk-liquid-191919.php" class="shared"><img src="new-assets/images/site/_WhatsApp.svg" alt=""> Share on WhatsApp</a>

        <p>Simultaneously phosphorus and potassium - a combination that delivers both these nutrients in equal proportion leading to enhanced root development, strong stem and stalk, and a robust DNA and RNA as well as getting a wide range of helpful enzymes helping the plant growth. It also plays a role in the stress-fighting strength of the crop with water movement within the plant. </p>
        <p>With ANBR’s innovative S⁴ and EA² technology, our liquid gel-based fertilizer products are a notch above any competition. The minute particle size of the nutrients substantially improves plant uptake. It also brings in an added benefit of the plants being able to absorb the nutrients and store them in pockets within the plant which facilitates the slow release of nutrients and utilization of the same as and when needed. It also reduces the dependence of farmers on conventional fertilizers to a great extent. </p>
        <p>With the added benefit of organic components, this product not only delivers nutrient efficiency but also makes the soil healthier and helps reduce soil pollution compared to conventional NPK fertilizers.</p>

        <h3><img src="new-assets/images/site/spec.svg" alt=""> Benefits </h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Promotes vegetative growth: The nitrogen content stimulates vegetative growth, including leaf development and overall plant vigor. It helps plants establish a strong foundation for healthy growth and efficient photosynthesis.</li>
            <li>Supports flowering and fruiting: The balanced phosphorus content encourages flowering and helps ensure adequate fruit set. It contributes to the development of healthy, high-quality flowers and fruits.</li>
            <li>Boosts plant health and stress tolerance: The potassium content helps plants withstand adverse conditions such as drought, temperature fluctuations, and disease. It supports cell function, water regulation, and enzyme activation, promoting optimal plant health and resilience.</li>
            <li>Enhances root development: Stronger and more extensive root systems improve nutrient uptake, water absorption, and overall plant resilience.</li>
            <li>The balanced nutrition provided by this product can result in increased crop yield and improved quality.</li>
            <li>Organically activated for better uptake and movement of nutrients.</li>
        </ol>
        <p><b>Recommended stage of usage:</b>  Being an all-around NPK solution, it can be applied during any stage of plant growth; however, ideally, it can be applied during the vegetative stage and fruiting stages of the plant life cycle since that is when the plants generally need nutrients the most. </p>
