                <h1>NPK Liquid 100040</h1>
                <p>A mixture fertilizer consisting of Nitrogen and Potassium, ANBR’s Emulsion-based NPK Liquid NPK 10:00:40 focuses on the deficiency or requirement of Potassium in the plants in addition to a small portion of Nitrogen. Potassium (K) essentially plays a significant role in plant physiological processes. Therefore, it is required in large amounts for proper growth and reproduction in plants.</p>
                <p>Using NPK 10:00:40 results in quicker germination, improved root development, and elevated abiotic stress tolerance; leading to better plant establishment, more vigorous growth, and higher yields. In addition, it is further enhanced by the integration of the S⁴ and EA² Technology, which promotes the absorption and translocation of nutrients.</p><a href="https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=https%3A%2F%2Fanbr.in%2Fnpk-100040.php" class="shared"><img src="new-assets/images/site/_WhatsApp.svg" alt=""> Share on WhatsApp</a>

        <p>NPK 10:00:40 Liquid Fertilizer plays a crucial role in enhancing fruit sugar content, fruit size, and overall plant health. Its high potassium content facilitates water and protein movement, activating vital enzymes for energy production and waste excretion.</p>
        <p>Using our in-house research-based innovative process of Microfluidisation, nutrients are ground into a microfluid that has minute particles. This microfluid is an emulsion-based liquid, which can be easily absorbed by the plants and can be stored within the plant for slow and timely release as and when needed.</p>
        <p>Easily soluble in water, this liquid solution for the farmers can easily be applied using any of the existing irrigation or fertigation processes that the farmer may prefer. It is very easy for the plants to uptake and the innovative technology used to make this product ensures that farmers get the most out of the product at lesser costs than conventional fertilizers.</p>
