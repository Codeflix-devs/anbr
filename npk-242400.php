                <h1>NPK Liquid 24:24:00</h1>
                <p>Our NPK 24:24:00 Liquid Fertilizer, is a powerful solution designed to meet the specific nutritional needs of your plants and promote vigorous growth.An equal ratio of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) in a fertilizer plays a vital role in supporting plant growth and development. This balanced nutrient ratio ensures that plants receive adequate amounts of each essential element for their optimal health and productivity.</p>
                <p>Nitrogen (N) is crucial for promoting vegetative growth, leaf development, and overall plant vigor. It is involved in protein synthesis, enzyme production, and chlorophyll formation, which are essential for various metabolic processes within plants.</p><a href="https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=https%3A%2F%2Fanbr.in%2Fnpk-242400.php" class="shared"><img src="new-assets/images/site/_WhatsApp.svg" alt=""> Share on WhatsApp</a>

        <p>Phosphorus (P) is vital for photosynthesis and sugar metabolism in plants. It is primarily acquired by plant roots as inorganic orthophosphate ions from the soil water. Phosphate-based fertilizers play a crucial role in replenishing phosphorus levels in the soil, as it is continuously taken up by plants. These fertilizers help optimize soil pH, promote root development, enhance stem and stalk formation, and improve plant resilience to environmental stressors.</p>
        <p>Experience the cutting-edge technology of ANBR's liquid emulsion-based fertilizer products, featuring the revolutionary S⁴ and EA² technologies. Our innovative approach sets us apart from the competition, providing you with unparalleled benefits for your plants.</p>
        <p>Unlock the potential of our fertilizers through the minute particle size of the nutrients, significantly enhancing plant uptake. Your plants will not only absorb the nutrients more efficiently but also store them in special pockets within their structure. This unique feature enables a slow release of nutrients, allowing your plants to utilize them precisely when needed.</p>

        <h3><img src="new-assets/images/site/recommended.svg" alt=""> Benefits</h3>
        <ul class="dosage">
            <li>High N and P in 1:1 ratio gives an ideal start to the crop.</li>
            <li>High -N concentration helps in plant growth and chlorophyll synthesis due to better mobility.</li>
            <li>High-P, helps in early and profuse root development,crop maturity and seed production.</li>
            <li>It is largely responsible for root growth and flower and fruit development.</li>
            <li>Important for starch and protein synthesis</li>
            <li>The liquid form allows quick and efficient nutrient absorption by the plant's root system.</li>
            <li>Enhanced plant nutrition leads to healthier plants that can better withstand environmental stressors and maximize their yield potential.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>Recommended stage of usage :</b>This fertilizer can be used during the initial seedling stage, and root development stages and can be used until the flowering stages since both Nitrogen and Phosphorus are present in this fertilizer abundantly and can help during the initial developmental stages of the plant life cycle. </p>
