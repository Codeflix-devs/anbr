                <h5>Enrich Atomic Absorption</h5>
                <h4>Pushing the Boundaries of Nutrient Uptake</h4>
                <img class="my-5" src="assets/img/innovation/ea2.jpg" alt="">
                <h5>Description</h5>
                <p>The <strong>EA<sup>2</sup></strong> Technology (<strong>E</strong>nrich <strong>A</strong>tomic <strong>A</strong>bsorption) was developed by ANBR Elixir Private Limited, to enhance the uptake and movement of nutrients within the plants.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Leveraging decades of experience in plant nutrition product development, <strong>EA<sup>2</sup> </strong>Technology is based on the integration of a combination and integration of organic factors within ANBR products. The exact composition of the cocktail is individually fine-tuned for each product to account for differences in nutrient composition, physicochemical properties and expected use (foliar, drip) to guarantee the best possible increase in product efficacy.</p>

                <h5>Technology Characteristics</h5>
                <p>The organic factors used by the <strong>EA<sup>2</sup></strong> Technology share certain characteristics:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li> They have a <strong>low molecular weight,</strong> which facilitates their uptake by the plant.</li>
                        <li> They <strong>do not compete for metallic ions</strong> once within the plant, unlike traditional chelating agents (i.e. EDTA). </li>
                        <li> They <strong>fully dissolve</strong> within the plant acting as carbon sources.</li>
                        <li> They are <strong>functional</strong> in conditions of plant abiotic stress.</li>
                        <li> They work in <strong>both acidic and alkaline pH.<strong></li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                <h5>Mode of Action</h5>
                <p>Although the exact mode of action of the <strong>EA<sup>2</sup></strong> Technology differs between the components used, the technology enhances three aspects of the products use.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Speed and extent of nutrient uptake</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Movement of the nutrients within the plant</strong></li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <h5>Nutrient Uptake</h5>
                <p>When nutrient is foliarly applied, a percentage of them is unable to enter the plant due to the negative charge of the leaves cuticle.</p>
                <p>To resolve this issue, certain of the organic factors used in <strong>EA<sup>2</sup></strong> Technology, bond to nutrients creating neutral organic molecules. This allows greater uptake as the cuticle’s charge does not interact with the neutral molecules (Fig. 1).</p>

                <br>
                <!-- <p>University studies have also shown that E2DA® Technology increases the speed of uptake, with maximum uptake being registered in under two arrows, which renders products integrated with the technology, rain-safe (Fig. 2)</p> -->

                <br>
                <h5>Movement within the Plant</h5>
                <p>With traditional fertilizers, once inside the plant, nutrient efficacy is limited by cell walls, whose presence mean that:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The plant must expend energy to absorb nutrients within the cells, meaning that fertilizer efficacy significantly drops in conditions of abiotic stress.</li>
                    <li>The nutrients primarily move through the apoplastic pathway, which results in their slow, non-uniform translocation within the plant.</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <p><strong>EA<sup>2</sup></strong> Technology uses a series of organic factors that act as dipoles enabling bonded nutrients to enter the cells without the expending of energy by the plant. This enables nutrient to move through both apoplastic and symplastic pathways resulting in faster more uniform translocation (Fig. 2). In addition, it makes products integrated with EA<sup>2</sup> Technology usable even in conditions of stress.</p>
