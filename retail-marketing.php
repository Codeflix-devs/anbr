                            <h2>NPK Fertilizers</h2>
                            <p>NPK fertilizers are the most basic and very popular fertilizers for any grower/farmer. It is a combination of 3 primary Macronutrients namely: Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus(P) and Potassium (K). One of the fastest moving products of any market region are NPK fertilizers. The farmers are randomly told that they need a particular NPK mixture ratio; however, seldom are they educated on what is required, and in what ratios by the plants that they are planning to cultivate. It becomes paramount to inform the end user in order to have a market that is ultimately targeting a well informed customer. This is where we come in, we help educate the end users (farmers) and the sellers alike in order to have a well formed sales strategy based on genuine inputs from the end users directly. </p>
                            <p>ANBR Elixir Private Limited has a vast range of NPK fertilizers, which in our goal to achieve the best, has driven us into developing groundbreaking EA² technology and S4 technology. These research based technologies have helped us immensely in delivering Nano Fertilizers, and Gel-based Fertilizers. These products have helped us outgrow and out-deliver than a lot of competing options</p>

                            <h2>Bio Stimulant</h2>
                            <p>Biostimulants are products that reduce the need for fertilizers and increase plant growth, resistance to water and abiotic stresses. In small concentrations, these substances are efficient, favoring the good performance of the plant’s vital processes, and allowing high yields and good quality products. Since the awareness for such a product range is not on desired levels especially in a country like ours, it becomes tantamount to bring these products in the eyes of the sellers and users alike. Field demonstrations come very handy when it comes to such new products being introduced to the users. Since they do not know the benefits and uses of the products, it is best to demonstrate the traits and results of the product along with educating the target demographic. </p>
                            <p>ANBR Elixir Private Limited offers best in category bio stimulants that outperform a lot of its competition and delivers outstanding results each time.</p>
