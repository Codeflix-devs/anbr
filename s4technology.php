                        </p>
                        <p>The S<sup>4</sup> Technology (Supernano Sustainable SuspoSolution) developed by ANBR Elixir Private Limited, with the intention to break the barriers imposed by traditional formulation technologies of liquid or solid fertilizers.</p>
                        <p>Leveraging decades of formulation expertise and in-depth knowledge of plant nutrition we have put in our efforts in introducing this new innovative Nano-Microfluidizer Emulsion technology for product development. S<sup>4</sup> Technology allows for formulations not possible until today.</p>
                        <h3>The Liquid – Nano Emulsion Form</h3>
                        <p>Products integrated with the S<sup>4</sup> Technology are nano emulsion liquid, instead, they have a unique form with a liquid emulsion texture. The raw material is broken down in a stage-wise manner till it is of the scale of nano-emulsion particles. Our in-house researchers have indigenously formulated an organic bio-degradable compound that enables the crop to uptake the nutrients with utmost ease and efficacy. This helps the slow and timely release of nutrients as and when needed without any unnecessary wastage of supplied nutrients </p>
                        <p>The material thus formulated is very easily consumed by the plant. The minute size means that the nutrients can also enter the plant through the leaf cells and making it extremely easily storable within the plant and then slowly released and used as and when needed in a slow and controlled manner. This makes the usage economical since it reduces the quantity required and also brings down the wastage.
                        </p>

            <div class="row">
                <p>This innovative formulation type allows for:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><span>High concentrations</span></li>
                    <li><span>Long shelf-life</span> </li>
                    <li>Highly concentrated nutrition based nano fluid based emulsion makes it more effective than conventional fertilizers. </li>
                </ul>
                <p>While liquid products with high concentrations are prone to phase separation and sedimentation. S<sup>4</sup> Technology’s Nano emulsion formulation prevents such issues.</p>
                <p>The viscosity of S<sup>4</sup> formulations changes over time in storage, form an emulsion like state, keeping all components in suspension.</p>
                <p>This transformation is not permanent but can be fully reversed by simple agitation of the product.</p>

                <h3>Formulation Possibilities</h3>
                <p>S<sup>4</sup> formulations are not limited to any particular raw materials since the S<sup>4</sup> Technology allows the simultaneous use of two or more types of materials in the same formulation. This allows unique and innovative raw material combinations, that extend the agronomic possibilities and create new frontiers in nutrition.
                </p>
                <p>These formulations are thus, very effective while being more durable, and economical.
                </p>
                <p>Some of the possibilities offered are:</p>
                <ul class="">
                    <li> The <span>addition of NPK sources</span> regardless of form allowing the use of the more efficient ones.</li>
                    <li> <span>Use of pH stabilizers</span> allowing the use of even high alkaline or acidic raw material sources.</li>
                    <li><span>Inclusion</span> of surfactants, organic activators, isolated vitamins, isolated plant hormones and enzymes.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>All of the above, contribute to the creations of products with higher efficacy than that provided by traditional formulation technologies.</p>
                <h3>Benefits</h3>
                <p>The possibilities offered by S<sup>4</sup> Technology, carry both agronomic and marketing advantages bring to both product quality and product performance parameters result in significant advantages for both organizations and growers.</p>
