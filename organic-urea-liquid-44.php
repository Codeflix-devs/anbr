                <h1>ORGANIC + UREA Liquid 44%</h1>
                <p>Urea, for ages, has been considered one of the best sources of Nitrogen for plants. It is very helpful in the growth and development of crops during crucial stages. Nitrogen compounds synthesize amino acids and nucleic acids. Urea, a source of Nitrogen, helps plants improve root development and promote lushness in the leaves. </p>
                <p>Using our in-house research-based innovative process of Micro fluidisation, nutrients are ground into a microfluid that has minute particles. This microfluid is an emulsion-based liquid, which can be easily absorbed by the plants and can be stored within the plant for slow and timely release as and when needed.</p><a href="https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=https://anbr.in/organic-urea-liquid-44.php" class="shared"><img src="new-assets/images/site/_WhatsApp.svg" alt=""> Share on WhatsApp</a>

        <p>Since ANBR’s Organic + Urea Liquid 44% is an emulsion-based liquid, it is easy to apply using existing methods of farmers. It can easily penetrate the soil even if the soil is hardened and not very porous. </p>
        <p>Our innovative technology and research have led us to deliver liquid urea with a minimum Nitrogen content of 44%. This effective Nitrogen becomes available to plants, making their growth robust, making the leaves greener, and assisting in photosynthesis. </p>
        <p>A product that can easily be absorbed by the plants because of the liquid form with tiny particles that can easily penetrate the pores on leaves even if they are just sprayed with the fertilizer. Nitrogen is a vital component of Chlorophyll. It also plays a significant role as the building block of proteins within plants. It is also responsible for the creation of amino acids and the movement of energy within the plant. </p>
        <p>In addition to having a well-researched and innovative product, ANBR delivers a product that has organic components which help improve soil health and improve complete soil ecosystems by enhancing the helpful microbial population within the soil. Organic components also help improve the soil’s water-holding capacity and reduce soil erosion, among other benefits. </p>

        <h3><img src="new-assets/images/site/spec.svg" alt=""> BENEFITS</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Increased nutrient use efficiency: It has a significantly higher nutrient use efficiency compared to conventional urea. It is designed to deliver nitrogen (N) in a more targeted and controlled manner, allowing for better absorption and utilization by plants. This results in reduced nutrient losses, minimized environmental impact, and improved crop productivity.</li>
            <li>Lower application rates: It requires lower application rates compared to conventional fertilizer.Due to its enhanced efficiency, a smaller amount of Organic + Urea Liquid 44% is needed to achieve the same or even better results, leading to cost savings and reduced fertilizer requirements by 60-70% .</li>
            <li>Reduced leaching and volatilization: It is formulated to minimize nutrient leaching and volatilization leading to improved nutrient retention in the root zone, ensuring that more nitrogen is available to plants.</li>
            <li>Controlled release of nutrients: The controlled release of nitrogen aligns with the crop's nutrient requirements, reducing the risk of nutrient overload or deficiency.</li>
            <li>Improved crop yield and quality: The enhanced efficiency and controlled release of nitrogen contribute to improved crop yield and quality. It supports healthy plant growth, enhances nitrogen availability during critical growth stages, and promotes overall crop productivity. It can also lead to improved crop attributes such as higher protein content, better fruit set, and increased grain yield.</li>
            <li>Environmental sustainability: It helps minimize nutrient runoff, groundwater contamination, and greenhouse gas emissions associated with traditional urea fertilizers. Using Organic + Urea Liquid 44% supports sustainable agricultural practices and reduces the ecological footprint of crop production.</li>
            <li>Soil improvement: Organic + Urea Liquid 44% enriches the soil with organic matter, which improves soil structure, moisture retention, and nutrient-holding capacity. It promotes the growth of beneficial soil microorganisms, enhances soil fertility, and supports overall soil health.</li>
            <li>Improved plant vitality: The organic matter in Organic + Urea Liquid 44% helps stimulate soil microbial activity, which enhances nutrient availability and uptake by plants. This leads to improved plant vitality, better stress tolerance, and overall healthier plant growth.</li>
        </ol>
        <p><b>Recommended stage of usage :</b> Ideally during the tilling stages so that can be utilized right from the beginning for root development and post that it is utilized by the plant throughout its life cycle. Also during the vegetative stage for the lushness in leaves; for the chlorophyll. </p>
