                <h1>NPK Liquid 20:10:10</h1>
                <p>A complex fertilizer mixture of all three primary macronutrients, Organic + NPK Liquid 20:10:10 is a comprehensive solution that delivers Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), and Potash/Potassium (K) in a fixed ratio. </p>
                <p>Nitrogen being present in a bigger ratio in this product, it helps in the root development and vegetative growth of the crops. With the benefits of vigorous enzyme activation within the plant that helps the plant grow and become strong enough to fight stress conditions, and a robust root development system, this product also delivers excellent vegetative growth. It helps secrete amino acids and build proteins within the plant. </p>

        <p>It plays an immensely important role in improving the sugar content in the fruits and the fruit size as well. Since it also facilitates in the movement of water, and proteins within the plant, this potassium-rich fertilizer triggers the activation of important biochemical enzymes for the generation of Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP). ATP provides energy for other chemical and physiological processes such as the excretion of waste materials in plants. It also plays a major role in helping plants cope with biotic and abiotic stress conditions. </p>
        <p>Easily soluble in water, this emulsion-based liquid solution for the farmers can easily be applied using any of the existing irrigation of fertigation processes that the farmer may prefer. It is very easy for the plants to uptake and the innovative technology used to make this product ensures that farmers get the most out of the product at lesser costs than conventional fertilizers. </p>
        <p>With our unmatched S⁴ and EA² technology, our fertilizers rise above the competition. The tiny nutrient particles dramatically enhance plant uptake, allowing them to efficiently absorb and store nutrients within their structure. This enables a slow and timely release, ensuring optimal utilization by the plants whenever needed.

        <h3><img src="new-assets/images/site/recommended.svg" alt=""> Benefits</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>

                Balanced nutrient supply: The NPK ratio of 20:10:10 indicates a balanced blend of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K). This balanced formulation provides plants with the necessary nutrients for healthy growth and development.
            </li>
            <li>

                Promotes vigorous growth: The high nitrogen content (20%) in the fertilizer stimulates leaf and stem growth, resulting in lush and vigorous plants. Nitrogen is crucial for the synthesis of proteins, enzymes, and chlorophyll, which are essential for plant growth.
            </li>
            <li>

                Enhances flowering and fruiting: The moderate phosphorus content (10%) supports flower and fruit formation. Phosphorus is involved in energy transfer, root development, and reproductive processes, leading to improved flowering and fruiting.
            </li>
            <li>

                Improves plant health and stress tolerance: The potassium content (10%) in the fertilizer helps enhance plant vigor and overall health. Potassium regulates various physiological processes, improves disease resistance, and promotes stress tolerance, allowing plants to withstand environmental challenges.
            </li>
            <li>

                Convenient application: Liquid fertilizers offer ease of application, as they can be easily dissolved in water and applied directly to the soil or foliage. This allows for efficient nutrient uptake by plants and ensures uniform distribution.
            </li>

        </ol>
        <p><b>Recommended stage of usage :</b>
            Since Nitrogen is the primary nutrient of this mixture, this product ideally can be used during the root development stages; however, the presence of Phosphorus and Potassium in the product makes it usable at all subsequent stages as well. </p>
        <h3><img src="new-assets/images/site/recommended.svg" alt=""> Recommendation Crops</h3>
        <p>It can be used for almost all cereals, leguminous plants, pulses, leafy vegetables, and other vegetative and fruit-bearing crops.</p>
