                <h1>ORGANIC +NPK Liquid 004055</h1>
                <p>An emulsion-based liquid mixture fertiliser made from the combination of the two essential macronutrients Phosphorus and Potassium in a ratio of 40:55. A combination that delivers both these nutrients in equal proportion leading to enhanced root development, strong stem and stalk and a robust DNA and RNA as well as getting a wide range of helpful enzymes helping the plant growth. It also plays a role in the stress-fighting strength of the crop with the movement of water within the plant.</p>
                <p>Using our innovative processes of EA<Sup>2</Sup> and S<Sup>4</Sup> technology, and state-of-the-art microfluidiser technology, we deliver effective products that deliver exceedingly satisfying results for the farmers while being cost-effective as well. </p><a href="https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=https%3A%2F%2Fanbr.in%2Fnpk-0000465.php" class="shared"><img src="new-assets/images/site/_WhatsApp.svg" alt=""> Share on WhatsApp</a>

        <p>Since Potassium is known as the “Quality” nutrient, it shows an immensely positive effect on quality factors such as size, shape, colour, and vigour of the seed or grain, and improves the fibre quality of cotton.</p>
        <p>Being an emulsion-based liquid fertiliser, it is very easy for the plants to uptake and the innovative technology used to make this product ensures that farmers get the most out of the product at lesser costs than conventional fertilisers.</p>
        <p>Having the added benefit of organic components, this product not only delivers in terms of nutrient efficiency but also makes the soil healthier and helps reduce soil pollution compared to conventional NPK fertilisers.</p>
        <p>NPK ratio 00:40:55, you primarily focus on providing a significant amount of phosphorus and potassium to plants. This can be particularly beneficial for crops that require an extra boost in flowering, fruiting, and root development.</p>

        <h3><img src="new-assets/images/site/spec.svg" alt=""> Advantages </h3>
        <ol>
            <li>It can be used throughout the crop cycle to strengthen the overall plant health..</li>
            <li>It is a multi-dimensional foliar tonic for cell-strengthening & brix-building</li>
            <li>It helps enhance plant vigor, improves resistance to drought and disease, and contributes to overall plant health and productivity.</li>
            <li>It plays a crucial role in energy transfer, photosynthesis, and overall plant metabolism.</li>
            <li>Beneficial for promoting robust root systems, improving flowering, and enhancing fruit or seed production.</li>
            <li>Enhances stomatal growth & chlorophyll synthesis.</li>
            <li>Prevents leaf, flower and fruit drop under stressed conditions</li>
            <li>Better development of grains/fruits results in higher weight and size</li>
            <li>It aids in the regulation of water uptake, nutrient transport, and enzyme activation within plants.</li>
            <li>The addition of organic components enriches the fertilizer with organic matter, providing additional nutrients and improving overall soil health.</li>
            <li>Organic component increases the soil's water-holding capacity, improves aeration, and enhances microbial activity. It also aids in nutrient retention and reduces the risk of soil erosion.</li>
        </ol>
        <p><b>Recommended stage of usage : </b>
            This NPK mixture is best for the flowering and fruiting stages of the crop life cycle. <br> This type of fertilizer is commonly used during the reproductive and maturation stages of the crop cycle, when the plant requires more phosphorus and potassium for the development of flowers, fruits, and seeds.
