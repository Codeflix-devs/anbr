                <h1>Liquid DAP Nano Emulsion Fertilizer</h1>
                <p>
                    It is the most concentrated phosphate-based fertilizer a farmer can get. A perfect solution for the phosphorus nutrition requirements of plants. Phosphorus is an essential nutrient for plants when it comes to RAN and DNA formation of the plants. Since this NPK mixture has Phosphorus in principal amounts, it also helps in cell division and facilitates growth during root development stages. Similarly, it plays a vital role in seed production stages. It is a very commonly used NPK mixture in the form of DAP (Di Ammonium Phosphate). </p>
                <p>Using our in-house research-based innovative process of Microfluidisation, nutrients are ground into a microfluid that has minute particles. This microfluid is an emulsion-based liquid, which can be easily absorbed by the plants and can be stored within the plant for slow and timely release as and when needed. </p>

            Since ANBR Liquid NPK 18:46:00 is an emulsion-based liquid, it is easy to apply using existing methods of farmers. It can easily penetrate the soil even if the soil is hardened and not very porous. The minute particle size of the nutrients substantially improves plant uptake. It also brings in an added benefit of the plants being able to absorb the nutrients and store them in pockets within the plant which facilitates the slow release of nutrients and utilization of the same as and when needed. It also reduces the dependence of farmers on conventional fertilizers to a great extent.

        <p>It plays a very important role in photosynthesis and the metabolizing of sugars. Plant roots can only acquire P from the soil when it is dissolved in soil water. Since only deficient concentrations of P are present in the soil water, P must be continually replenished from soil minerals and organic matter to replace the P taken up by plants. Plant roots generally absorb P as inorganic orthophosphate ions (HPO4 2- or H2PO4 - ). Phosphorus present in soil organic matter is not available for plant uptake until soil microbes convert the organic compounds into simple inorganic phosphate. This is precisely where phosphate-based fertilizers play their part. Especially DAP can be applied during the tilling period since it also helps optimize the pH levels of the soil and eventually helps in root development. Since it also helps stem and stalk formation and strength, it plays a major role in helping plants cope with unfavourable environmental conditions. </p>
