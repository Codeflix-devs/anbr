                <h1>Calcium + Magnesium Liquid</h1>
                <p>An effective combination of two important secondary nutrients, Organic + Calcium Magnesium Liquid is a very effective substitute for soil conditioners to an extent. It covers the 2 major components of conventional soil conditioners and delivers them to the plants in a much more easily consumable form.</p>
                <p>Calcium is essential to plants for their growth and nutrition. It is an essential element for the cell structure since it serves as a constituent for cell walls and cell membranes and hence it is also considered as the structural nutrient for the plant. It also plays a vital role in enzyme activation, such as amylase which is involved in the germination process. Calcium also assists in the movement of carbohydrates within the plant. Also, it is essential for root structure development, especially the tips and meristems. </p><a href="https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=https%3A%2F%2Fanbr.in%2Fcalcium-magnesium-liquid.php" class="shared"><img src="new-assets/images/site/_WhatsApp.svg" alt=""> Share on WhatsApp</a>

        <p>The inclusion of magnesium in the liquid fertilizer provides an additional essential nutrient for plants. Magnesium is a central component of chlorophyll molecules, contributing to photosynthesis and overall plant energy production. Magnesium also plays a role in enzyme activation and nutrient uptake. The fortified magnesium in the liquid fertilizer ensures plants have access to this important nutrient.</p>
        <p>Together these nutrients give a booster of nourishment and nutrition to the plants which cannot be substituted or replaced. With ANBR’s innovative S<Sup>4</Sup> and EA<Sup>2</Sup> technology, our Emulsion based microfluid fertilizer products are a notch above any competition.</p>
        <p>In addition to having a well-researched and innovative product, ANBR delivers a product that has organic components which help improve soil health and improve complete soil ecosystems by increasing the helpful microbial population within the soil. Organic components also help improve the soil’s water-holding capacity and reduce soil erosion, among other benefits.</p>
        <h3><img src="new-assets/images/site/spec.svg" alt=""> Specifications</h3>
        <p>Despite phosphorus (P) availability from geologic deposits distributed around the globe, widespread P deficiency in soils limits the growth and productivity of plants in many parts of the world. Because of this, growers commonly add this nutrient to their fields to improve crop yield and quality. Polyphosphate is an excellent liquid P fertilizer used to increase agricultural production.</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Increases drought and disease resistance </li>
            <li>Improves chlorophyll production. </li>
            <li>Enhances cell wall health.</li>
            <li>Improves leaf colour, fruit quality and shelf-life</li>
            <li>Prevents fruit cracking & promotes healthy fruit development </li>
            <li>The increased leaf, flower and fruit calcium allows for less risk of physical damage as well as greater resilience to physiological breakdown.</li>
            <li>Prevents and cures magnesium deficiencies.</li>
            <li>Prevents a number of calcium linked disorders.</li>
            <li>The organic components leads to improved soil structure,enhanced nutrient retention,microbial activity promotion, increased soil fertility .</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            <b>Recommended stage of usage :</b>
            It is ideal to use this product during the root development stages since calcium helps strengthen the root tips, and also during the flowering and fruiting stages since both magnesium and calcium assist in the activation of enzymes.
