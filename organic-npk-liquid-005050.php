                <h1>ORGANIC + NPK Liquid 005050</h1>
                <p>ORGANIC + NPK 00:50:50 is a highly concentrated emulsion containing macro and chelated micro elements. It includes organic component which has proven beneficial effects upon plants by stimulating root development. It is useful to maximise the production of crops at risk of damage from stress conditions, caused by high temperatures, soil conditions, moisture availability and disease. It is formulated to supply seedlings and more mature plants with essential nutrients.</p>
                <p>The phosphorus and potassium combination in the ORGANIC + NPK 00:50:50 is particularly advantageous for flowering and fruiting plants. Adequate phosphorus encourages flower formation and improves fruit set, while potassium supports fruit development, quality, and taste. This fertilizer can enhance flower and fruit production, resulting in higher yields and improved crop quality.</p><a href="https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=https://anbr.in/organic-npk-liquid-005050.php" class="shared"><img src="new-assets/images/site/_WhatsApp.svg" alt=""> Share on WhatsApp</a>

        <p>The organic component contributes organic matter to the soil, improving soil structure, moisture retention, and nutrient-holding capacity. They help enhance soil fertility and promote the growth of beneficial soil microorganisms.</p>
        <p>Using our in-house research-based innovative process of Microfluidisation, nutrients are ground into a microfluid that has minute particles. This microfluid is an emulsion-based liquid, which can be easily absorbed by the plants and can be stored within the plant for slow and timely release as and when needed.</p>
        <h3><img src="new-assets/images/site/spec.svg" alt=""> Specifications</h3>
        <p>Despite phosphorus (P) availability from geologic deposits distributed around the globe, widespread P deficiency in soils limits the growth and productivity of plants in many parts of the world. Because of this, growers commonly add this nutrient to their fields to improve crop yield and quality. Polyphosphate is an excellent liquid P fertilizer used to increase agricultural production.</p>
