                    <p>With the welcome change of farmers giving as much importance to soil health and soil fertility as their agricultural productivity, we have taken it upon ourselves to fulfill those needs. ANBR Elixir Private Limited proudly boasts of a range of products in the Microbial and Organic segments that have given clear beneficial results for the users.  A key component of soil organic matter are populations of soil microbes. Living microbes in soil help supply plants with nutrients, and a diverse community of soil microbes provides protection against pest and disease outbreaks. Common agricultural practices that have been going on since ages have been reducing the population of helpful microbes in soil and overall soil health, but there are ways of improving soil quality to prevent this from happening.</p>

                        <p>ANBR Elixir Private Limited crop care solutions help improve soil health by feeding beneficial soil microbes and by improving soil moisture. ANBR products contain complex bioactive compounds that encourage optimal soil health so that plants can thrive in their environment.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>They contain amino acids (the building blocks of plant proteins) that serve as a food source for beneficial microbes in the soil.</li>
                            <li>They contain alginic acid (a complex carbohydrate) that also serves as a food source for beneficial soil microbes, and it improves soil moisture by mixing with certain molecules in the soil to form salts that swell up when wet to retain water.</li>
                            <li>They contain different types of saccharides (natural sugars) that feed bacteria in the soil that help free up nutrients for plants.</li>
                        </ul>
