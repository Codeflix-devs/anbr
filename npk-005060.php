                <h1>Liquid NPK 00:50:60</h1>
                <p>An emulsion-based liquid mixture fertilizer made from the combination of the two essential macronutrients Phosphorus and Potassium in a ratio of 50:60. A combination that delivers both these nutrients in equal proportion leading to enhanced root development, strong stem and stalk and a robust DNA and RNA as well as getting a wide range of helpful enzymes helping the plant growth. It also plays a role in the stress-fighting strength of the crop with the movement of water within the plant. </p>
                <p>Phosphorous is an essential nutrient that plays a vital role in promoting root growth, enhancing flowering and fruiting, and supporting overall plant growth.Whereas Since Potassium is known as the “Quality” nutrient, it shows an immensely positive effect on quality factors such as size, shape, color, and vigour of the seed or grain,</p><a href="https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=https%3A%2F%2Fanbr.in%2Fnpk-005060.php" class="shared"><img src="new-assets/images/site/_WhatsApp.svg" alt=""> Share on WhatsApp</a>

        <p>With ANBR’s innovative S⁴ and EA² technology, our liquid emulsion-based fertilizer products are a notch above any competition. The minute particle size of the nutrients substantially improves plant uptake. It also brings in an added benefit of the plants being able to absorb the nutrients and store them in pockets within the plant which facilitates the slow release of nutrients and utilization of the same as and when needed. It also reduces the dependence of farmers on conventional fertilizers to a great extent. </p>
