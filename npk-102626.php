                <h1>NPK Liquid 10:26:26</h1>
                <p>Our NPK Liquid 10:26:26 is a premium liquid fertilizer designed to provide essential nutrients to plants during critical growth stages. This balanced formula contains Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), and Potassium (K) in a ratio of 10:26:26, ensuring optimal nutrition for flowering and fruiting plants. With high concentrations of phosphorus and potassium, this fertilizer promotes robust root development, vigorous flowering, and abundant fruit production.</p>
                <p>With a higher ratio of P and K, you can get a complete solution for macronutrient deficiency of all three primary nutrients. Nitrogen which is the most readily found nutrient in the atmosphere may be needed in lesser quantities for some crops in certain soil types.With the benefits of vigorous enzyme activation within the plant that helps the plant grow and become strong enough to fight stress conditions, and a robust root development system, this product also delivers excellent vegetative growth. It helps secrete amino acids and build proteins within the plant.</p><a href="https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=https%3A%2F%2Fanbr.in%2Fnpk-102626.php" class="shared"><img src="new-assets/images/site/_WhatsApp.svg" alt=""> Share on WhatsApp</a>

        <p>Using our in-house research-based innovative process of Microfluidisation, nutrients are ground into a microfluid that has minute particles. This microfluid is an emulsion-based liquid, which can be easily absorbed by the plants and can be stored within the plant for slow and timely release as and when needed.</p>
        <p>With ANBR’s innovative S⁴ and EA² technology, our liquid gel-based fertilizer products are a notch above any competition. The minute particle size of the nutrients substantially improves plant uptake. It also brings in an added benefit of the plants being able to absorb the nutrients and store them in pockets within the plant which facilitates the slow release of nutrients and utilization of the same as and when needed. It also reduces the dependence of farmers on conventional fertilizers to a great extent.</p>

        <h3><img src="new-assets/images/site/recommended.svg" alt=""> Benefits</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Balanced nutrient ratio: The balanced NPK ratio of 10-26-26 provides a proportional supply of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K). This balance supports overall plant growth, development, and productivity.</li>
            <li>Vegetative growth: Nitrogen promotes the development of lush green foliage, healthy stems, and vigorous vegetative growth. It is necessary for the synthesis of proteins, enzymes, and chlorophyll, which are essential components for plant structure and photosynthesis.</li>
            <li>Promotes root development: The moderate phosphorus content in the fertilizer stimulates root growth, leading to stronger and healthier root systems. It enhances nutrient uptake, water absorption, and plant resilience.</li>
            <li>Flowering and fruiting promotion: The elevated phosphorus and potassium levels in the NPK 10-26-26 fertilizer are particularly beneficial for flowering and fruiting plants. They support flower formation, fruit development, and improved fruit quality and yield.</li>
            <li>Enhances plant health and stress tolerance: Potassium plays a vital role in plant health and stress tolerance. The higher potassium content in the fertilizer helps plants withstand environmental stressors such as drought, temperature fluctuations, and diseases. It supports overall plant vitality and resilience</li>
        </ol>
        <p><b>Recommended stage of usage :</b>Being an all-around NPK solution, it can be applied during any stage of plant growth; however, ideally, it is applied during the flowering and fruiting stages of plant growth.</p>
