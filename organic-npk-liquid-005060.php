                <h1>ORGANIC +NPK Liquid 005060</h1>
                <p>
                    An emulsion-based liquid mixture fertilizer made from the combination of the two essential macronutrients Phosphorus and Potassium in a ratio of 50:60. A combination that delivers both these nutrients in equal proportion leading to enhanced root development, strong stem and stalk, and a robust DNA and RNA as well as getting a wide range of helpful enzymes helping the plant growth. It also plays a role in the stress-fighting strength of the crop with the movement of water within the plant. </p>
                <p>Using our innovative processes of EA² and S⁴ technology, and state-of-the-art microfluidiser technology, we deliver effective products that deliver exceedingly satisfying results for the farmers while being cost-effective as well.

        <p>Since Potassium is known as the “Quality” nutrient, it shows an immensely positive effect on quality factors such as size, shape, color, and vigour of the seed or grain, and improves the fiber quality of cotton.

        </p>
        <p>Being an emulsion-based liquid fertilizer, it is very easy for the plants to uptake and the innovative technology used to make this product ensures that farmers get the most out of the product at lesser costs than conventional fertilizers.

        </p>
        <p>Having the added benefit of organic components, this product not only delivers in terms of nutrient efficiency but also makes the soil healthier and helps reduce soil pollution compared to conventional NPK fertilizers.

        </p>
        <p>An ideal option for growers who want to fulfill the deficiency of 2 nutrients with one product.

        <h3><img src="new-assets/images/site/spec.svg" alt=""> Advantages </h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Balanced phosphorus and potassium levels can help improve soil fertility over time.
            </li>
            <li>

                It helps replenish nutrient levels, enhance nutrient cycling, and contribute to the overall health and productivity of the soil.
            </li>
            <li>

                Ideal to provide plants with enhanced disease resistance, improved stress tolerance (such as drought or extreme temperatures), increased photosynthesis efficiency,
            </li>
            <li>

                It is a multi-dimensional foliar tonic for cell-strengthening & brix-building
            </li>
            <li>

                It can provide targeted nutrition to some crops, optimizing their growth, productivity, and overall quality.
            </li>
            <li>

                Promotes root and top growth. Increases root mass and boosts canopy
            </li>
            <li>

                Enhances stomatal growth & chlorophyll synthesis.
            </li>
            <li>

                It can help promote abundant flowers, increased fruit set, and improved yield for crops that heavily rely on fruiting and flowering stages.
            </li>
            <li>

                It aids water regulation, and nutrient transport within plants
            </li>
            <li>

                The addition of organic components enriches the fertilizer with organic matter, providing additional nutrients and improving overall soil health.
