                <h1>NPK Liquid 0:35:30:8</h1>
                <p>NPK 00:35:30:08, an emulsion-based liquid fertilizer is a high-quality formulation designed to meet the nutritional needs of plants. It contains a precise combination of essential nutrients, including phosphorus (P), potassium (K), and boron (B). This specific ratio of nutrients is carefully formulated to support robust growth, healthy root development, and improved crop yield.</p>
                <p>The added benefit of high Boron (B) content provides solutions to problems caused due to boron deficiency like light general chlorosis, death of growing points, deformed leaves with areas of discoloration, etc. Boron aids in the improved uptake of Phosphorus (P) and Potassium (K) by improving the root structures and cell- membranes. This is exactly why this mixture fertilizer works best in tandem since the boron helps the uptake of the rest of the two nutrients.</p><a href="https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=https%3A%2F%2Fanbr.in%2Fnpk035308.php" class="shared"><img src="new-assets/images/site/_WhatsApp.svg" alt=""> Share on WhatsApp</a>

        <p>With ANBR’s innovative S⁴ and EA² technology, our liquid emulsion-based fertilizer products are a notch above any competition. The minute particles of the nutrients substantially improve plant uptake. It also brings in an added benefit of the plants being able to absorb the nutrients and store them in pockets within the plant which facilitates the slow release of nutrients and utilization of the same as and when needed. It also reduces the dependence of farmers on conventional fertilizers to a great extent. </p>
        <p>Being an Emulsion-based liquid fertilizer, it is very easy for the plants to uptake and the innovative Microfluidiser technology used to make this product ensures that farmers get the most out of the product at lesser costs than conventional fertilizers. </p>

        <ol>
            <li>Phosphorus for root development and flowering: Phosphorus is vital for root growth and development. It helps plants establish a strong root system, which enhances nutrient and water uptake. Additionally, phosphorus plays a crucial role in flower formation, seed production, and overall reproductive development.</li>
            <li> Potassium for plant health and stress tolerance: Potassium is involved in numerous physiological processes within plants, including enzyme activation, osmoregulation, and photosynthesis. It contributes to overall plant health, disease resistance, and stress tolerance. Potassium also aids in nutrient translocation and carbohydrate metabolism.</li>
            <li>Boron for cell wall formation and sugar transport: The addition of boron provides an important micronutrient to the fertilizer formulation. Boron is essential for the formation and integrity of cell walls, helping to ensure proper cell division and elongation. It also aids in the transport of sugars and the regulation of other essential plant hormones.</li>
            <li>Convenient application: Liquid fertilizers are easy to apply and can be sprayed directly onto plants or incorporated into irrigation systems.</li>
            <li>Improved nutrient uptake and efficiency: NPK 0:35:30:08 is in a liquid emulsion form, which allows for efficient nutrient absorption by plants. The nutrients are readily available in a soluble form, making them more accessible to the plants' root systems. This promotes efficient nutrient uptake and utilization, reducing the risk of nutrient wastage.</li>
            <li>Enhanced crop yield and quality: NPK 0:35:30:08 supports optimal plant growth, development, and productivity. By supplying plants with the necessary nutrients, the fertilizer can contribute to improved crop yield, quality, and marketability.</li>
        </ol>
        <p><b>Recommended stage of usage : </b>The NPK 00:35:30:08 liquid fertilizer can be applied during the seedling, vegetative, flowering, and fruit development stages of crops. Applying it during these stages promotes healthy root development, vigorous vegetative growth, improved flower formation, and enhanced fruit development.</p>
